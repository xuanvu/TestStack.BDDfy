{"name":"BDDfy","body":"### What's with the name?\r\nThe framework is called BDDfy because it BDDfies (as in turns into BDD) your otherwise traditional unit tests. Oh and BTW it is pronounced B D Defy. With BDDfy it is very simple to turn your AAA tests into a BDD test/behavior. BDDfy can work with any and all testing frameworks. In fact, it works even if you are not using any testing framework.\r\n\r\n### How to get going\r\n1. Install NuGet if you have not already.\r\n2. Go to 'Tools', 'Library Package Manager', and click 'Package Manager Console'.\r\n3. In the console, type 'Install-Package TestStack.BDDfy' and enter. \r\n\r\nThis adds the BDDfy assembly to your test project. \r\n\r\nIf this is the first time you are using BDDfy you may want to check out some of the samples on NuGet. Just search NuGet for BDDfy and you will see a list of BDDfy samples. You may install one or more samples to see how the framework works. Each sample installs required packages (including BDDfy and NUnit).\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n* BDDfy can run with any testing framework. It does not force you to use any particular framework. Actually BDDfy does not force you to use a testing framework at all. You can just apply it on POCO classes even in a console app if that is what you need!\r\n* BDDfy does not need a separate test runner. You can use your runner of choice. For example, if you like NUnit, then you may write your BDDfy tests using NUnit and run them using NUnit console or GUI runner, Resharper or TD.Net and regardless of the runner, you will get the same result. This means it integrates with the tools you know and love instead of adding yet another one on the top of them.\r\n* BDDfy can run standalone scenarios. Although BDDfy supports stories, you do not necessarily have to have or make up a story to use BDDfy. This is useful for developers who work in non-Agile environments but would like to get some decent testing experience.\r\n* You can use underscored or pascal or camel cased method names for your steps.\r\n* You do not have to explain your scenarios or stories or steps in string: BDDfy infers them based on conventions but you can override the conventions if you need full control over what gets printed into console and HTML reports. Conventions galore in BDDfy and pretty much everything has a convention; but it is also very easy to override these conventions.\r\n* BDDfy is very extensible. In fact, BDDfy core barely has any logic in it. It delegates all its responsibilities to its extensions.\r\n* BDDfy learning curve is rather flat. Not only that but it makes learning BDD effortless.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMehdi Khalili (@MehdiK), Michael Whelan (@mwhelan)","tagline":"BDDfy is the simplest BDD framework EVER!
